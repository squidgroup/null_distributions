Comments:


- improper prior gives frequentist which is least biased, at least when the models are simple. 
- However, this prior is generally not advised. Under more reasonable priors the median performs the best, and appears the most to prior choice



- coverage
 - the difference between HPDI and quantile based methods might be interesting

- HPDI intervals will be dependent on the kernel density estimator - so will change dependent on the smoothing
  - quantile based methods might not include the mode (but will include the median and most likely the mean)

- in discussion of power analysis?
- but coverage will be high when power is low
- so not completely helpful for study design


- null distribution of large and small sample sizes compare to illustrate the utility 



at end - all the ways that null distributions/null models are useful

mention loo AIC in discussion?

How to section in supplements





Possible things for a literature review


To address whether our simulations realistic, and what the extent of the problem is


Bayesian or frequentist?

If Bayesian 
 - what summary statistic is used
 - is it justified
 - if mode 
 	- is estimation method mentioned (function/parameters)
  - is estimation method justified
 - Is size of the posterior mentioned
  - what size if the posterior
 %- if univariate
 %- what prior is used
